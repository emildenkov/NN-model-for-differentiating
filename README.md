# NN-model-for-differentiating
Neural Network model which can be trained to differentiate images.
For this case I used teraflow, keras and matplotlib
In my case I wanted from my model to make a difference whether it is a dog on the photo or something else.
If you test the model by yourself you need to provide a good amount of images so it can be trained properly.
